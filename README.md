# Weather-Grapher
An app that takes in any city and a specific time period and creates a graph based on various weather options that the user can choose (such as avg temp, pressure, precipitation, etc...).

Uses the meteostat web API. Unfortunately, this web API does not have data for a lot of big cities like New York but it should have data for most big cities, like Los Angeles, Chicago, London, Orlando, Madrid, etc... 

NOTE: When you open the executable, your antivirus will most likely see it as a threat and will try to shut it down. This is due to the nature of pyinstaller, which converts python files into executables. To use the app, you have prevent your antivirus from trying to block it. I can't figure out how to solve this problem, but if anyone knows how to then please email me! 

If you want to install it, I recommend using the installer file as the program needs an icon image in order to work. If you don't have the icon image, the program will not be able to run, but the installer installs both the executable and the icon image in the same directory.
