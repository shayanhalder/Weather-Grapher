# Weather-Grapher
An app that takes in any city and a specific time period and creates a graph based on various weather options that the user can choose (such as avg temp, pressure, precipitation, etc...).

Uses the meteostat web API. Unfortunately, this web API does not have data for a lot of big cities like New York but it should have data for most big cities, like Los Angeles, Chicago, London, Orlando, Madrid, etc...
